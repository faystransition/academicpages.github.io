- I showed the numerical study of resonance mode for sign-changing d-wave superconductors from 2D (cylindrical Fermi surface) to 3D (corrugated cylindrical Fermi surface with hot lines gradually closing).
- It is the topology of the hot lines instead of Fermi surface that matters for the disappearance of resonance mode.
